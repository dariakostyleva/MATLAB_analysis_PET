Sensitivity correction

Procedures in 3 scripts below are not completely correct due to matrix multiplication
1. Sensitivity_correction.m script does correction based on 10 files where PMMA is on pin 5
2. Sensitivity_atten_pin1_correction.m does correction based on 10 files where PMMA is on pin 1
3. Sensitivity_atten_pin2_correction.m does correction based on 10 files where PMMA is on pin 2
Thus I start yet another script with sensitivity correction but based on 5 files only and no matrix multiplication
4.  Sensitivity_correction_v2.m based on 5 files (PMMA pin 5) and interpolation
5.  Sensitivity_atten_pin1_correction_v2.m based on 5 files (PMMA pin 1) and interpolation
